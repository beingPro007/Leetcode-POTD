## Introduction

This repository contains my personal solutions to the daily LeetCode problem of the day (POTD), organized by topics. Each solution is written in a clean, efficient, and well-documented manner to help others understand the thought process and approach.

## Structure

The repository is organized into various topics or categories, each with its own folder:

```

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem 1.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem 2.md
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Strings
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem 1.md
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Problem 2.md
